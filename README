This repositoty contains RTL, testbench code for an Arithmetic Logic Unit using arithmetic and logical operators.

The following instructions have been taken care while writing the source code of the ALU.
> To Write down the functionality of ALU.
> Understand tri-state output logic.
> Withing always@(command) begin
  - The ALU has to perform 16 different operations using command input on 8bits input a_in and b_in.
  - If the MSB of the command_in input is Low, then the arithmetic operations are performed.
  - If the MSB of the command_in input is High, then the logical operations are performed.
  - Use case construct to perform the operations.
  - The output is of 16 bits. Input "oe" (output enable) enables the ALU. i.e., when the oe is low output is at High Impedance.
